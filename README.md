# Markdown to html

This is a test markdown to html converter with a curvy table of contents which gets headings from a html AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) with a custom markdown processor. This table of contents observes all html headings (h1-6) on a page and highlights an active one

Also there is a funny theme switcher (from light to dark and backwards) with sounds :)

This project is mostly about mobX learning

# Getting started

Nothing special here, just standard `vite` commands
